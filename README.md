## Project Overview

The project focuses on solving real-world business problems using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The objective is to provide practical, hands-on experience with industry datasets, combining theoretical knowledge with practical implementations. You will work on analyzing datasets, performing statistical analysis, and developing data-driven insights for business decision-making.

## Problem Statement

### Part I - Applied Statistics

You are required to address a set of industry-relevant questions using statistical methods. These questions include scenarios such as joint probability calculations, Poisson distribution applications, and normal distribution evaluations. 

Specific tasks include:
- Determining joint probabilities from given data.
- Analyzing manufacturing defect rates using binomial probability.
- Evaluating a car salesman's weekly performance using Poisson distribution.
- Assessing order recognition accuracy for a speech-based bot in a restaurant.
- Calculating student performance statistics based on a normal distribution model.

### Part II - Basketball Team Performance Analysis

The dataset provided contains performance metrics for various basketball teams from past tournaments. Your goal is to analyze team performance and recommend which teams a management company should invest in. The analysis should include insights derived from key performance indicators like games played, games won, and baskets scored.

Key objectives include:
- Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- Conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to extract insights.
- Identifying top-performing teams based on historical data.
- Recommending teams for investment based on performance metrics.
- Developing a performance report based on the analysis.

### Part III - Startup Ecosystem Analysis

You are provided with a dataset from an online tech publisher focusing on the startup ecosystem. The dataset contains key attributes like startup names, products, funding, event participation, and operating status. The goal is to analyze the data and draw meaningful conclusions regarding startup performance across various events and regions.

Key tasks include:
- Data preprocessing: reading the dataset, handling missing values, and formatting data for analysis.
- Conducting statistical analysis to compare the performance of startups still operating vs those that have closed.
- Hypothesis testing on startup performance across different regions and events.
- Visualizing distributions of key metrics like funding and success rates.
- Providing insights and recommendations based on the analysis.
